#this file helps to send messages more efficient and in a global way
#can put a message in entity class like @NotBlank(message = "aaa"),
#but picture 50 properties with this message, so this file will help to personalize and don't do inside entity
#This file type is called Resource Bundle, resources package, where we can put messages and delivery as a pack
#And this one is a resource Bundle of spring, there's a bundle of bean validation, but I'm going to use this one
#bundle of spring has preference, subscribes bundle of bean validation

#to use need to put annotation name, entity class and property name(attribute name) and message
#NotBlank.restaurant.name=Restaurant name is required
#NotBlank.kitchen.name=Kitchen name is required

#more general message {0} is a placeholder, like a var that will receive something, like a 'name'
NotBlank={0} is required
PositiveOrZero={0} need to be greater than or equal to 0
NotNull={0} is required, can't be null
#NotBlank.name=Name is required, need something; #this one will have preference because is more specific than NotBlank={0} is required,
#can use both, can choose one of them to use or restaurant.name=Restaurant name like this too

Invalid.DeliveryTax={0} invalid

#Restaurant


#can personalize placeholder this way
restaurantRequest.name=Restaurant name
restaurantRequest.deliveryTax=Delivery tax
restaurantRequest.kitchenIdRefRequest=Need to specify Restaurant kitchen, so
restaurantRequest.kitchenIdRefRequest.id=Kitchen id
#since I'm not using entity domain, need to change to what is being used, like 'restaurantRequest' if other classes is using DTOs too, need to do the same

#Kitchen

kitchenRequest.name=Kitchen name

#State

stateRequest.name=State name

#City

cityRequest.name=City name
cityRequest.StateIdRefRequest.id=State id
cityRequest.StateIdRefRequest=Need to specify City state, so

#Payment method
